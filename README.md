# Face Generation with VQGAN and Seq2Seq Transformer
This project implements a combination of the VQGAN and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer models to generate lifelike faces from textual descriptions. By leveraging these powerful deep learning models, we aim to create highly realistic and diverse facial images based on the input text.
